# ft_ls
about : ft_ls is a BASIC recreation of the unix command "ls" using C

can do 👍 : [~ls -l]
            [~ls -a]
            [~ls -r]
                    [~ls -R]
                    [~ls]
                    [~ls (multiple directories)]
                    [~ls -l (multiple files)]
                    [[~ls -a -l] / [ls -a -r] etc.]
ft_ls can only combine 2 flags at a time, the '-R' flag however still needs work, and can't be combined with any other flags.

can't do 👎 :    combine more than 2 flags
                          the -l flag only works on the current directory
                          there is no block size displayed
                          despite no visible bugs (the '-t' flag doesn't work)
